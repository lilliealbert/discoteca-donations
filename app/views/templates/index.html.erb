          <p class="mb-4">Greetings from Thomas Edison Charter Academy!</p>
          <p class="mb-4">I'm reaching out as a proud parent of a student at Thomas Edison Charter Academy (TECA), a nonprofit Title I public school serving TK-8th grade students in the Mission. Each year, the TECA PTA hosts a fundraiser and auction that helps fund essential programs and student enrichment opportunities. I'm writing to ask if you'd be willing to support our students with a tax-deductible donation from your business.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">This year's auction will be held on May 8, 2026. We expect about 100 attendees, a mix of parents and teachers, who would be delighted to support your business. In the past, the generosity of community businesses and organizations has enabled us to build a library, install a turf soccer field, and enrich our science curriculum.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">In recognition of your generosity, your company's name will appear on the event promotional materials and signage, both online and at our in-person auction. This is an outstanding opportunity to promote your business among a local audience, all while improving the lives of students in your community.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Digital donations can be emailed to the address below or sent directly to the school. We are also happy to generate a gift certificate on your behalf or pick up physical items if you provide us the details. Please contact me with any questions or if you need to schedule pick-up of an item for donation.</p>
          <p class="mb-4">Thank you for considering this opportunity to help our students flourish!</p>

          <p class="mt-6">Sincerely,<br>
