    <p class="mb-4">Hello!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm reaching out one last time about Thomas Edison Charter Academy's auction fundraiser on May 8, 2026. Our donation deadline is approaching, so this will be my last ping :)</p>
    <p class="mb-4">If you're able to contribute, we'd be so grateful for any donation—gift cards, products, services, or experiences all make wonderful auction items. Your business will be recognized on our event materials and in front of our community of parents and teachers.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">If you're unable to participate this year, no problem at all. Thank you for taking the time to consider our request, and we hope to connect with you in the future!</p>

    <p class="mt-6">All the best,<br>
