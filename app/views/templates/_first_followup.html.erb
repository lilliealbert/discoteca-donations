    <p class="mb-4">Hello!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I wanted to follow up on my previous message about supporting Thomas Edison Charter Academy's annual auction fundraiser. I know how busy things can get, so I wanted to reach out in case my earlier email got lost in the shuffle.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Our auction will be held on May 8, 2026, and we're still looking for local businesses to contribute donations. Any contribution, big or small, makes a real difference for our students and helps fund essential programs at our Title I public school in the Mission.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">As a reminder, your business will be recognized on our event materials and signage, giving you great visibility among our community of parents and teachers.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">If you have any questions or would like to discuss donation options, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're happy to make the process as easy as possible for you.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Thank you for considering!</p>

    <p class="mt-6">Best regards,<br>
