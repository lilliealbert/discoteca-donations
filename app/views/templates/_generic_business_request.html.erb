    <p class="mb-4">Greetings from Thomas Edison Charter Academy!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm the proud parent of a student at Thomas Edison Charter Academy (TECA), a nonprofit Title I public school serving TK-8th grade students in the Mission. Each year, our PTA hosts a fundraiser and auction that helps fund essential programs and student enrichment opportunities. I'm writing to ask if you'd be willing to support our students with a tax-deductible donation.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">This year's auction will be held on April 17. We expect about 100 attendees, a mix of parents and teachers, who would be delighted to support your business. In the past, the generosity of community businesses and organizations has enabled us to build a library, install a turf soccer field, and enrich our science curriculum.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">In recognition of your generosity, your company's name will appear on the event promotional materials and signage, both online and at our in-person auction. This is an outstanding opportunity to promote your business among a local audience, all while improving the lives of students in your community.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Thank you for considering this opportunity to help our students flourish!</p>

    <p class="mt-6">Sincerely,<br>
      <span><%= current_volunteer.name || "[Your Name]" %></span><br>
      <span>TECA PTA member</span><br>
      <span class="text-indigo-600"><%= current_volunteer.email || "[Your Email]" %></span>
